## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hey there! I'm Pedro Mirassol, a passionate tech enthusiast and aspiring full stack developer. My journey into the world of programming began with a fascination for technology and how it shapes our lives.

I dove deeper into the tech landscape through my training at Code for All, where I honed my skills in both front-end and back-end development. I thrive on solving complex problems and turning innovative ideas into functional applications, embracing every challenge that comes my way.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me at the gym or out for a run. Just like in coding, fitness teaches me resilience and adaptability, especially when facing unexpected challenges.

Let's connect! I'm eager to discuss technology, share insights, and collaborate on exciting projects. Together, we can make a difference in the tech world!
